# Description
# This script checks if all the tests are included in the matrix in the test step in ci-databricks.yml.
# It is used in the pipeline to ensure that all the tests are included in the matrix.
# The script must be invoked with a filter matching the paths NOT included in the matrix

# $@: (Optional) Can be set to specify a filter for running python tests at the specified path.

# Exit immediately with failure status if any command fails

# This script runs pytest with the --collect-only flag to get the number of tests.
# 'grep' filters the output to get the line with the number of tests collected. Multiple lines can be returned.
# 'awk' is used to get the second column of the output which contains the number of tests.
# 'head' is used to get the first line of the output which contains the number of tests.
# Example output line returned by the grep filter: 'collected 10 items'
