  specifically that grid loss calculation is correct.
  
  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
  - Input period is post May 2023 so that results are quarterly

cases_tested:
  "Unusual Grid Area Setups":
    - "Grid Area With Only Non Profiled Mp"
    - "Energy Supplier Only Has Grid Loss Mp Or System Correction Mp"
