  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose is to test every resolution (from 1H to 15M), es and brp change for metering point types relevant for energy
  results.

  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
  - Input period is post May 2023 so that results are quarterly
  - Metering point id's denote the type
      - Production metering points start with e.g. '18' for production metering points
      - Metering points with resolution 15M have a 15 in them
      - Nonprofiled metering points end with 1xx, flex with 2xx
      - Example - flex metering point with resolution 15M: '**17**000000**15**00000**2**01'

cases_tested:
  "Metering Point Master Data Updates":
    - "Change Of Resolution On An MP"
    - "Change Of Balance Responsible On An Mp"
    - "Change Of Energy Supplier On An MP"
    - "Energy Supplier Change On Grid Loss MpP"
    - "Energy Supplier Change On System Correction MP"
    - "Balance Responsible Change On Grid Loss MP"
    - "Balance Responsible Change On System Correction MP"
