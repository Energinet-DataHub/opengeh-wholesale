  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose of this test is the scenario where a grid area has no consumption metering points,
  specifically that grid loss calculation is correct.
  
  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
  - Input period is post May 2023 so that results are quarterly
  - Input data is mostly minimal standard scenario, but without consumption metering points.

  "Unusual Grid Area Setups":
    - "Grid Area With Only Production Mp"
    - "Energy Supplier Only Has Grid Loss Mp Or System Correction Mp"
