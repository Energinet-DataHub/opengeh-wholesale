"""This package is empty, but is created to state that there _may_ exist a database `wholesale_migrations_wholesale` in the database.

The database is created and used in some environments (dev_00x) where it is
desired to decouple the wholesale subsystem from the migrations subsystem.
In those cases population of the data is the responsibility of the wholesale subsystem.
