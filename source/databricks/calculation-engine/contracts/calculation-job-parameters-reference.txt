# This file is kind of a contract between the parameters used by .NET invocation of the calculator job
# and the parameters expected by the calculator job.
# There is a test on both sides verifying that both conform to the same parameters format
# and that the calculator job is able to consume the parameters.
#
# Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignores in the tests.
