"""
Schema for charge link periods (and charges)

Charge link periods are only used in settlement.
Periods (given by `FromDate` and `ToDate`) must not overlap but may have gaps.
Gaps may occur if the link has been removed for a period before being added again.

Data must be stored in a Delta table.

The table must be partitioned by `ToDate`: ToDate_Year/ToDate_Month/ToDate_Day.
It is important to partition by to-date instead of from-date as it will ensure efficient data filtering.
This is because most periods will have a to-date prior to the calculation period start date.

The table data must always contain updated periods.
