    This type is used to distinguish wholesale result. There are three groups:

    AMOUNT_PER_CHARGE: fee/tariff/subscription per hour/day (later maybe also quarter) per charge key (code, type,
    and owner). The amounts are calculated per metering point type.

    MONTHLY_AMOUNT_PER_CHARGE: fee/tariff/subscription per month per charge key (code, type, and owner).
    The amounts are summed across metering point types.

    TOTAL_MONTHLY_AMOUNT: Total sum of amounts per month across charge codes and charge types
