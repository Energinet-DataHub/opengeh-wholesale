  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose of this test is the scenario that an exchange metering point is in a grid area, but is exchanging between two other grid areas than the one it is in.
  
  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
  An E20 sending power into the grid area is included, otherwise we cannot calculate grid loss. But no readings are included for it in time series.
