  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose of this test is to test every energy result calculation (along with basis data) with the smallest meaningful
  time period (one hour).
  
  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
  - Input quantities have deliberately set to produce different quarterly results due to rounding for at least one of each
    metering point type
  - Input quantities have been set so production, flex, and nonprofiled do not produce the same result.
  - Input data has MPs not included in calculation
  - Energy Supplier and Balance Responsible id's have set so that ga_es, ga_brp and ga_brp_es do not produce the same
    result/rows.
  - Oracle Excel-sheet included (Oracle - minimal standard calculation.xlsx)
  - Metering point id's denote the type
      - Production metering points start with e.g. '18' for production metering points
      - Metering points with resolution 15M have a 15 in them
      - Nonprofiled metering points end with 1xx, flex with 2xx
      - Example - flex metering point with resolution 15M: '**17**000000**15**00000**2**01'
