    ## Purpose
    The purpose is checking views related to amount per charge view.

    ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
    wholesale_internal.calculations table has three calculation_id's, only one of which is valid.
    The two others are either internal or don't have an end date.
    These three ids are used across all 6 basis_data tables.

  cases_tested:
    "Data Product Tests":
      "Wholesale Basis Data Tests":
        - "Only Calculation Ids In Internal Calculations Included"
        - "Only External Calculation Ids Included"
        - "Calculation Ids Without Calculation Succeeded Time Not Included"
