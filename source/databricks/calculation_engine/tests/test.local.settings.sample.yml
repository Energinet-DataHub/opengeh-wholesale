migrations:
  # Use this setting to speed up development by controlling when to execute which migrations in test sessions.
  # Options: NONE | ALL | MODIFIED
  # `ALL` is the default if not provided as this is similar to the CI behavior.
  #
  # Pro-tips:
  #     - Try MODIFIED and if doesn't work for you use ALL. Hopefully just once and then revert to MODIFIED
  #     - If you need to repeatedly update and execute a script you'll likely want to or need to
  #       temporarily add a DROP view|table statement at the beginning of the script to avoid conflicts.
  execute: MODIFIED
