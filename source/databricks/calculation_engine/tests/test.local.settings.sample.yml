migrations:
    # Use this setting to speed up development by controlling when to execute which migrations in test sessions.
    # Options: NONE | ALL | MODIFIED | MODIFIED_AND_SUBSEQUENT
    # `ALL` is the default if not provided as this is similar to the CI behavior.
    # Recommendation: Try MODIFIED and if doesn't work for you then try MODIFIED_AND_SUBSEQUENT before switching to ALL.
    execute: MODIFIED
