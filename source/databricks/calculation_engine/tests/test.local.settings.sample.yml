migrations:
  # Use this setting to speed up development by controlling when to execute which migrations in test sessions.
  # Options: NONE | ALL | MODIFIED
  # `ALL` is the default if not provided as this is similar to the CI behavior.
  #
  # Pro-tips:
  #     - Try MODIFIED and if doesn't work for you use ALL. Hopefully just once and then revert to MODIFIED
  #     - If you need to repeatedly update and execute a script you'll likely want to or need to
  #       temporarily add a DROP view|table statement at the beginning of the script to avoid conflicts.
  execute: MODIFIED

feature_tests:
  # Use this setting to enable or disable showing the entire contents of the dataframes actual and expected in the test console.
  # Options: True | False
  # `False` is the default.
  # Recommendation: Keep it as False.
  show_actual_and_expected: False

  # Use this setting to enable or disable showing equal columns from actual and expected in the test console.
  # Options: True | False
  # `False` is the default.
  # Recommendation: Keep it as False.
  show_columns_when_actual_and_expected_are_equal: False

  # Use this setting to enable or disable showing the number of rows of the dataframes actual and expected in the test console.
  # Options: True | False
  # `False` is the default.
  # Recommendation: Keep it as False.
  show_actual_and_expected_count: False


  # Use this setting to control whether the test framework should check for duplicate rows in the dataframes being compared.
  # Options: True | False
  # `False` is the default.
  # Recommendation: Keep it as False if you want faster test execution times. Set it to True when running locally and you
  # want a more specific error message when you have duplicate rows.
  assert_no_duplicate_rows: False
