# Given period is two days with MP period ending

The purpose is to test that we can handle a metering point being discontinued.

## Design considerations

- Input period is two days with four of the metering points ending between the two days
- On day 2, a new exchange metering point is initiated

## Coverage
 - MP is shut down in calculation period
