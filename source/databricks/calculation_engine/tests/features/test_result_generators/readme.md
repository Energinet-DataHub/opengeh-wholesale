# Result Generator Templates
These Excel-sheets can be used to generate expected results for calculation feature tests with limited input data sets. 
### Giant disclaimer!
Use with caution! If there is a mismatch between the results generated by the Excel-sheet and the calculation engine, assume the error is either in the Excel-sheet or your use thereof. The sheets are intented as a help to generate expected results - not verify those results. 
## Oracle Energy Calculation - Template.xlsx
Use this Excel-sheet to generate energy results. 
### Instructions
- Copy the sheet to root of the 'given_' scenario folder that you want to generate results for.
- (tip: rename the sheet to match the name of the scenario)
- Open the Excel-sheet, go to 'Data' tab and press 'Refresh All'
	- The sheet should automatically detect the input csv-files as data sources and generate results based on those.
- **Modify** the **WHITE** cells to select the results you need.
- **Copy** results from the **GREEN** cells. You should be able to paste them directly into the result-files in Pycharm.
### Limitations
In general, the sheet only works with small input dataset. 
- The sheet can only show results for **one hour** at the time. If you have measurements from multiple hours, you can select between the hours in cell B4.
- There is a limitation on how many metering points, energy suppliers etc. will fit into the sheet. E.g. sheet will not be able to handle if you have more than six energy suppliers in your metering_point_periods.
- It will only work if calculation is done on a **single area**. I.e. it cannot generate results for a calculation across multiple grid areas.
- Does not generate results for quantity qualities. You will have to set these manually. 
- **Only modify white cells**!  If you edit any other cells, you almost certainly mess up the sheet's reproduction of the calculation logic.

## Oracle Wholesale Calculation - Template.xlsx
Use this Excel-sheet to generate wholesale results. 
### Instructions
- Copy the sheet to root of the 'given_' scenario folder that you want to generate results for.
- (tip: rename the sheet to match the name of the scenario)
- Open the Excel-sheet, go to 'Data' tab and press 'Refresh All'
	- The sheet should automatically detect the input csv-files as data sources and generate results based on those.
- **Modify** the **WHITE** cells to select the results you need.
- **Copy** results from the **Yellow** tabs - copy the **Yellow** cells. You should be able to paste them directly into the result-files in Pycharm.
### Limitations
- The sheet can generate data for up to, but no more than 4 days.
- It does not calculate grid loss. So if you put tariffs on grid loss/system correction metering points, you will have to manually calculate tariffs.
- Does not generate results for quantity qualities. It will make a guess between 'measured' and 'missing', but that's it.
- It does **not** support result generation for charge links og charge masterdata which does not cover the entire calculation period (with the exceptin of fee charge links, which by defintion only cover 1 day).
