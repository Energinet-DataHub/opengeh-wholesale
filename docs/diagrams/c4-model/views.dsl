# The 'views.dsl' file is intended as a mean for viewing and validating the model
# in the domain repository. It should
#   * Extend the base model and override the 'dh3' software system
#   * Include of the `model.dsl` files from each domain repository using an URL
#
# The `model.dsl` file must contain the actual model, and is the piece that must
# be reusable and included in other Structurizr files like `views.dsl` and
# deployment diagram files.
