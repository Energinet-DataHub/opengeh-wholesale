## Getting Started for Developers

The source code of the repository is provided as-is. We currently do not accept contributions or forks from outside the project driving the current development.

For people on the project please read the internal documentation (Confluence) for details on how to contribute or integrate with the subsystem.

## The Public Data Models

The public data models are the data models that the wholesale subsystem provides for accessing the data related to calculations. The public data model is a delta lake and is accessed from Databricks.

Learn about the wholesale public data models [here](docs/public-data-models/README.md).
